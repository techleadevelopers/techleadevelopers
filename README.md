### ‚öôÔ∏è My Key Projects

<p>My work combines building software from start to finish with cool machine learning applications. Here are a few projects that show what I can do:</p>

<br>

<h3>‚ú® LimpeJ√° Marketplace (Full Stack & Mobile Marketplace)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>A mobile marketplace built with <b>React Native</b> and <b>Expo</b>. It‚Äôs designed to help people find cleaning and organization services easily.
      It handles everything from when a user signs up to when a service provider gets booked and paid, including scheduling and setting prices that change based on demand.
       Uses modern tech like <b>Expo Router</b>, <b>TanStack Query</b> for managing data efficiently, and <b>TypeScript</b> to make sure the code is solid.</p>
    </li>

</ul>

<br>

<br>

<h3>ü§ñ Bilingui-AI (Full Stack & Local AI)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>A fun language learning platform that uses <b>local AI models (Whisper & Mistral)</b> to give you real-time feedback on your speech and have conversations that make sense.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Built with a fast <b>FastAPI</b> backend and a responsive <b>React Native</b> frontend. It‚Äôs all about making learning feel like a game and keeping users engaged.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

<br>

<h3>üè• VitalFlow IA (AI for Healthcare)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>A smart platform that uses <b>AI to help hospitals manage things better</b> by predicting risks in real-time and making sure resources are used efficiently.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>This project focuses on being easy to check, helping prevent problems before they happen, and making decisions based on data in a really important field.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

<br>

<h3>üõ°Ô∏è SOC - APT Defense Universe (Cybersecurity & Simulation)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>A platform that <b>simulates a Security Operations Center (SOC)</b> to help train people who work in cybersecurity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Developed using <b>React and TypeScript</b>, this project demonstrates a good understanding of security stuff, how to <b>simulate data</b>, and how to build modern websites.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

### üõ†Ô∏è My Technical Skills

<p>I have a strong base in how software should be made and follow good practices to make sure everything is high-quality and easy to maintain.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p><b>AI/ML Lifecycle:</b> I know how to handle the whole process, from getting data ready and figuring out what features are important, to designing, training, and deploying models.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Clean Code & Design Patterns:</b> You can see this in projects like `nestjs-dependency-inversion`, where I use smart ways of organizing code like Dependency Inversion.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Agile Methodologies:</b> I have experience with project plans and working in short cycles (like in the Bilingui-AI project), which helps in delivering things regularly and staying on track.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
