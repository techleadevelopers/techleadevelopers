### ⚙️ My Key Projects

<p>My work combines building software from start to finish with cool machine learning applications. Here are a few projects that show what I can do:</p>

<br>

<h3>✨ LimpeJá Marketplace (Founder & Full Stack Developer)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>LimpeJá</b> is a <b>mobile-first marketplace</b> I founded and fully developed as the <b>sole engineer</b>.  
      It connects clients to cleaning professionals with the same practicality of <b>Uber</b> and trust layer of <b>Airbnb</b>.  
      The project was designed end-to-end by me — from product vision and market analysis to mobile app, backend architecture, and deployment in the cloud.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Mobile App (React Native + Expo)</b>: complete client & provider flows (registration, scheduling, chat, profile, reviews, payments).  
      Built with <b>Expo Router</b> for structured navigation, <b>TanStack Query</b> for efficient data caching, and <b>TypeScript</b> for scalability and reliability.  
      Includes advanced features like <b>dynamic pricing</b> (hourly, per room, per m², or fixed), coupon system, subscriptions, and LGPD-compliant data handling.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Backend (NestJS + Prisma + Postgres/PostGIS)</b>: modular and production-ready API.  
      Supports <b>real-time updates</b> (WebSockets), <b>queue processing</b> for heavy tasks, <b>Redis caching</b>, and <b>geospatial search</b> for nearby providers.  
      Implements <b>trust & safety layer</b> with document verification, selfie recognition, and background checks.  
      Integrated <b>PIX instant payments</b> with withdrawal in less than 24h, solving the biggest pain point for providers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Core Features</b>:  
      <ul>
        <li>📱 <b>Clean and intuitive UX (Uber-like)</b>: ultra-fast flow from splash → login → signup → personalized home → booking → PIX payment. Includes smart recommendations, cancellation policies, and in-app chat for seamless communication.</li>
<li>👩‍🔧 <b>Empowerment for providers</b>: complete autonomy to set prices, choose services, and manage schedules. Verified onboarding with document upload + facial recognition. Providers gain professional dashboards with history, earnings summary, and withdrawal requests — elevating the experience to "driver-of-app" status.</li>
<li>💸 <b>Financial transparency</b>: real-time earnings dashboard, upcoming jobs, and reviews. Instant PIX withdrawals (<24h) eliminate the #1 pain in the informal sector: uncertainty of payment. Dynamic pricing and surge incentives help fill idle hours and increase income.</li>
<li>🔐 <b>Security-first</b>: robust KYC (OCR + selfie + background check), device fingerprinting, and fraud prevention for coupons. LGPD compliance highlighted in onboarding for client trust. Optional service guarantee/insurance with simplified claims process directly in-app.</li>
<li>🤝 <b>Reputation system</b>: two-way ratings (client ↔ provider), badges like "Top of the neighborhood" and "100 services 5⭐", plus local ranking boards to reward consistency and quality. This builds community-driven trust.</li>
<li>📊 <b>Growth mechanics</b>: referral program with attractive credit, first-service coupons, recurring bookings with discounts, and subscription plans that include insurance and priority scheduling. Marketing playbook includes hyperlocal influencers, SEO (Google My Business), and B2B2C partnerships (condos, real estate managers, beauty salons, churches).</li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>What makes it unique</b>: Unlike generic competitors, LimpeJá was designed to be the first  
      <b>national reference in cleaning services</b> in Brazil, combining trust, speed, and economic empowerment.  
      Built entirely by me as a <b>solo founder & full stack engineer</b>, it demonstrates not only technical execution but also  
      <b>market vision, business model design, and go-to-market strategy</b>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>🤖 Bilingui-AI (Full Stack & Local AI)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>A fun language learning platform that uses <b>local AI models (Whisper & Mistral)</b> to give you real-time feedback on your speech and have conversations that make sense.</p>
      <p>Built with a fast <b>FastAPI</b> backend and a responsive <b>React Native</b> frontend. It’s all about making learning feel like a game and keeping users engaged.</p>
    </li>

</ul>

<h3>🏥 VitalFlow IA (AI for Healthcare)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>A smart platform that uses <b>AI to help hospitals manage things better</b> by predicting risks in real-time and making sure resources are used efficiently.</p>
      <p>This project focuses on being easy to check, helping prevent problems before they happen, and making decisions based on data in a really important field.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

<br>

<h3>🛡️ SOC - APT Defense Universe (Cybersecurity & Simulation)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>A platform that <b>simulates a Security Operations Center (SOC)</b> to help train people who work in cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>Developed using <b>React and TypeScript</b>, this project demonstrates a good understanding of security stuff, how to <b>simulate data</b>, and how to build modern websites.</p>
    </li>
   
</ul>

### 🛠️ My Technical Skills

<p>I have a strong base in how software should be made and follow good practices to make sure everything is high-quality and easy to maintain.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p><b>AI/ML Lifecycle:</b> I know how to handle the whole process, from getting data ready and figuring out what features are important, to designing, training, and deploying models.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Clean Code & Design Patterns:</b> You can see this in projects like `nestjs-dependency-inversion`, where I use smart ways of organizing code like Dependency Inversion.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Agile Methodologies:</b> I have experience with project plans and working in short cycles (like in the Bilingui-AI project), which helps in delivering things regularly and staying on track.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
