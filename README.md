## Core Engineering & Production Systems

### <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/limpeja/image/upload/v1771254811/Developer_3_qozne6.png" alt="swap Logo" width="80" align="center"> **Swappy Financial** - *High-Throughput Web3 Architecture*
> Corporate On/Off-ramp platform (Fiat <> Crypto) processing real-time transactions.

- **Distributed Architecture:** Built a Web3 engine based on **Microservices** with asynchronous communication to ensure eventual consistency in on-chain operations.
- **Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets:** Implemented key management (TRC20) via address derivation, ensuring fund isolation and hierarchical idempotency.
- **Idempotency & Security:** Double-spending and replay attack protection using distributed `nonce` systems, `ts-validation`, and HMAC-signed webhooks.
- **Infrastructure:** Automated **CI/CD pipelines using Terraform on Azure**, ensuring immutable environments and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- **Real-time UX:** Three.js integration for real-time visualization of network fees and gas instructions (TRX).

> Uber-like platform for cleaning services | **191 providers** | **251 active clients** | **R$ 82,850+ GMV**

- **Real-time Matching Engine:** Intelligent recommendation algorithm processing geolocation and availability in milliseconds for ultra-fast booking flows.
- **FinOps & Payout System:** Payment architecture integrated with PIX APIs, focused on financial transparency and instant withdrawals (<24h).
- **Identity & Compliance (KYC):** Image processing pipeline with OCR + Facial Recognition integrated into onboarding, ensuring LGPD (Data Privacy) compliance.
- **Observability:** Implementation of structured logging and metrics monitoring (SLIs/SLOs) to track acceptance rates and response times.

> Language learning platform with offline AI models

- **Edge Computing:** Migrated cloud models to **Local Inference (Whisper/Mistral)**, reducing API costs by 100% and inference latency by 75%.
- **High-Performance Backend:** API developed with **FastAPI** optimized for audio streaming and parallel processing.
- **Clean Architecture:** Decoupled AI models from business logic, allowing seamless LLM swapping and maintainability.
- **UX:** Gamified learning experience with 100% offline real-time feedback processing.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Expertise

- **Infrastructure & DevOps:** Terraform (IaC), Azure (AKS), Docker, Kubernetes (K8S), Helm, GitHub Actions, Nginx, Linux (Arch), Bash.
- **Architecture:** Microservices, Event-Driven, Hexagonal Architecture, REST/gRPC, Redis (Caching/Queue), RabbitMQ, Kafka.
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python (FastAPI/PyTorch/TensorFlow), TypeScript (NestJS/React/Next.js), Go, Rust, C++, Node.js, Spring.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Pinecone (Vector DB), SQLite, DynamoDB, Cassandra, Elasticsearch.

## 🧠 Architectural Philosophy
> I don't just write code, I design systems that scale. My priority is observability, resilience, and FinOps cost-effectiveness, ensuring that the infrastructure supports business growth without technical bottlenecks.
